# SORTING IN RUBY

This repository contains my implementations of common sorting algorithms. See below for a quick breakdown of each sorting algorithm and some links to learn more:

## SELECTION SORT
  Selection sort works by assuming the first number is the smallest number. It loops through the rest of the numbers, checking to see if there is a smaller number. If there is, the first number is switched with the smallest number; putting the smallest number in it's correct place. The loop then moves onto the element in index 2 and repeats the process, moving the next smallest number to its correct place, until the array is sorted.

  This algorithm has a O(nÂ²) time complexity and is an in-place sorting method.
